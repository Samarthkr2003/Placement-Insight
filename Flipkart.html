                <br><b>Pre Round</b>: To get a chance to participate in this coding rounds, we were asked to fill forms . the candidates  and were short listed here on the basis of pointer ( 7.5 and above  were all selected, for people with pointer 7  to 7.5, there projects and internships were taken into consideration to be allowed to appear in this round)  </br>
                <b>Round 1: Online Assesement Round</b>- 3 CODING questions in 90 mins on hackerrank.  </br>
                <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>

                <li>Was a simple question, all you had to do was find a PnC formula and just put the values in it to get the answer. </li>
                <li>Was based on array . This was a medium level question, 7/11 test case passed using brute force (O(n^2)). An accurate solution of which is actually in O (n), but i modified my code and managed to get all the 11 test cases right using just a slight modification in my brute force approach! </li>
                <li>A matrix was given, the solution to which was by applying  BFS on it but not exactly that. I could not understand the problem enough as I was running out of time ! 
                    The name of the Question was “Marathon” and said was a lot similar to some other famour problem named “Rat in a maze”. </li>
                <li> In this round out of 150 students, 22 were shortlisted for interviews, and 10 were kept on waiting list. 

                </li>
                
        </ul>
        
                
                 
               
                 <br><b>Round 2: Techincal Round 1</b> - In technical round one, all of us were asked 3 questions. The level of questions was actually easy, and most were selected only if they could answer all of the 3 right ! 
                 
                 <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
                    <li> N-1 elements in an array from 1 to n, find the missing one! </li>
                    <li><b> K distance sort </b>

    
                        He had clearly stated me that this can be done using normal sorting algo in O(nlogn), but I had to give a more optimized one. 
                        
                        I proposed a solution using a stack, which some how worked for the test case that he gave me, but he proved it wrong and gave me a hint to use another data structure, I got the hint and realised it  was to be done using min heap. Time complexity of which was O(nlogk) ! 
                        
                        </li>
                    <li><b>Circular tour </b>- For this question i gave him a more optimized solution than brute force but with the same complexity, but he did not give me much time for this question as they were running late on schedule. 
                    </ul>
                 </br>
                 <br><b>Round 3: Techincal Interview 2</b> - 17 out of 22 made it to this round. 

                <br> In this round the questions asked were tough, but the interviewer was very suggestive and kept dropping hints. 
                 <ul style=“list-style-type:square”>
                    <li> Sum of minimum elements of all sub arrays. </li>
                    <li> Cut off trees for golf </li>
                    <li> LRU cache implementation using array, stack/queue, doubly linked list, circular linked list, Hash map.

                    <li> Where do you see yourselves in 5 years? </li>
                    <li> What is your strength and weakness? To which I answered as hard working, being both my weakness and strength and justified it . </li>
                    <li> He asked me about my story if JEE and getting into this college. (11 STUDENTS SELECTED IN THE END)
